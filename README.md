# quarto_html_revealjs_test

Example on how to generate an html website and corresponding Reveal JS slides
from the same source Quarto Markdown file.

The script `render.sh` contains the code to render the project into the folder
`docs` which is served by GitHub Pages.

## TODO

- Create a GitHub action that does this automatically. I have added a new
  workflow and selected gh-pages branch. From the next commit the page should
  be build and published by the quarto actions.
